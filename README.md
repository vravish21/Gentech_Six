The case study presents a Lean Six Sigma project is to streamline Gentech's proposal creation process. Gentech, a market leader in providing integrated business solutions with a presence in over 150 countries, has experienced an 18% reduction in revenue over the past couple of years. The project was sponsored by Grace Monroe and managed by Jeff Hugh, a Lean Six Sigma Black Belt.

The objective was to analyze the current proposal creation process, identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies, implement process improvements, standardize the process across all regions, and train staff on new processes and tools. The scope included the proposal creation and internal review steps up until the final proposal submission to the client, excluding processes post-submission.

The project identified key stakeholders, including the executive leadership, supply chain operations, sales force, bid support staff, product design team, pricing group, and brand managers. Risks such as resistance to change and unforeseen delays were acknowledged, with mitigation strategies planned. The project assumed cooperation across regions and that the annual revenue would serve as the project budget.

The DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) methodology was applied. The Define phase set a goal to reduce operational cycle times by 15% to address the cumbersome and non-standardized proposal process impacting Gentech's competitiveness. The Measure phase established baseline metrics, including a Defects Per Million Opportunities (DPMO) of 21,672 and a Sigma level of 3.52, indicating the process's quality level.

The Analyze phase revealed long cycle times due to various factors, including inexperienced Bid Support Specialists (BSS), errors in configuration, and slow response rates. The Improve phase proposed solutions like training for the BSS team, simplifying the proposal process, and streamlining the submission process, among others.

Recommendations included using a workflow management tool for transparency, defining a "Bid Complexity" parameter to match bids with BSS based on their experience, and merging the pricing team and branding manager roles to improve efficiency.

The Control plan involved conducting regular performance evaluations, establishing a ticketing system for issues, and conducting monthly sync-ups to continuously improve the proposal process.
